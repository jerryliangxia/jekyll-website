Hi!

My name's Jerry :) I'm a software engineering student studying at McGill University.

### tech

Before university, I had limited experience with technology. I was into a lot of graphic design and art, so becoming a developer was something that I took a leap of faith towards. However, I knew at the very least, that I always loved dreaming up wild imaginations. [Dreamscapes][behance], the origins of the universe, a lot that had to do with physics and science. In my first year, I realized that the lines of logic I spun up were similar to how computer science works - knowing exactly where things go, how it all comes together to create some working thing. And so the journey began. I started off with what was fun - making small Javascript web [games][web-games], then moving on to join McGill's Game Dev team, making 2D and [3D][spongebob] platformer games in Unity. I explored my love for graphic design in McGill's Hack4Impact team, where I spun up designs for MU Montr√©al's [CRM][crm] system, and did some frontend programming as well. In the summer of 2021, I scored an internship at Gameloft, where I helped maintain the online infrastructure behind all of Gameloft's games. There I learned a lot about agile development, APIs, team version control and was nitpicked a lot for best development practices.

### interests

I've been playing guitar for around five years, and love to draw. I'm mostly self-taught with drawing, and 100% the case with guitar. I love to play folk music, as well as pop, and I'm trying to become more fluent in music theory so I can continue to write my own songs.

<!-- ### more

I think it's always important to pick up new things as we go along. As I'm writing this, I've started skateboarding just to see what it's like, and it's exhilarating. When fall comes around I'll pick up boxing with my friend, in part because the gym is becoming monotonous, and I think that life's finest hours are in experiencing new things.

As I grow older, I realize that the mind likes to fall into patterns of thought that can be destructive. It's also not best to stay positive all the time too, because it's just another way of running from your problems. I don't know much about our psyches, our future, and why life can often lack so much purpose, but I do believe in carpe diem. So with all that's available in the 21st century, I will always try new things, spend time with others, be a good friend, a good son, a good person. Because whether or not I fail or succeed, I think it's all still pretty cool to be here at the end of the day. -->
