Hi!

My name's Jerry :) I'm a software engineering student studying at McGill University.

### tech

Before university, I had limited experience with technology. I was into a lot of graphic design and art, so becoming a developer was something that I took a leap of faith towards. However, I knew at the very least, that I always loved dreaming up wild imaginations. Dreamscapes, the origins of the universe, a lot that had to do with physics and science. In my first year, I realized that the lines of logic I spun up were similar to how computer science works - knowing exactly where things go, how it all comes together to create some working thing. And so the journey began. I started off with what was fun - making small Javascript web games, then moving on to join McGill's Game Dev team, making 2D and 3D platformer games in Unity. I explored my love for graphic design in McGill's Hack4Impact team, where I spun up designs for MU Montr√©al's CRM system, and did some frontend programming as well. In the summer of 2021, I scored an internship at Gameloft, where I helped maintain the online infrastructure behind all of Gameloft's games. There I learned a lot about agile development, APIs, team version control and was nitpicked a lot for best development practices.

### interests

I've been playing guitar for around five years, and love to draw. I'm mostly self-taught with drawing, and 100% the case with guitar. I love to play folk music, as well as pop, and I'm trying to become more fluent in music theory so I can continue to write my own songs.
