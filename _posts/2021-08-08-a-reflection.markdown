The last two years have been really hard for everyone.

I've learned of some news from a friend recently and feel pretty bad about it. It shows that I'm not the only one with problems coming from the pandemic; some have it much worse, and it's about time we start looking out for each other because of that.

Last year, I made it a promise to be more present. The last year, it was the same thing. The year before that, the same. I feel like it's become a problem of constantly reaching for it, that makes me detached from being a part of what's around me. Now, I'm starting to learn from that :)

With how much is going on out there, I find the best thing for us to do is to have a silent understanding of how bad it can get, and use that as a baseline to become better people.

I remember someone telling me that as we get older, our problems deviate in size. But we become, overall _more aware_ of everything. I feel like right now, I'm at a stage where I can grow as a person and fully mature into some idea of who I want to be. And I think it starts with being true to feeling, and not think about how I should act or who I surround myself with. While I do think parts of that are important, there's still the core of me that I should always work on. And I'm going to stick with that for the rest of my life.

My new years resolution used to be all about putting myself out there. I'm still going to do that, but also take the time to determine who I'm going to be at the end of university. There's no picturesque goal in mind, really; just a rough idea of what I've seen before that's good, and my goal to become something alongside that.

Thanks for reading :)
