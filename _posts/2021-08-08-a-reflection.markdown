Development is cool!

Like, it's really nice. I've always wanted to do something where I can think as a problem solver, and apply my own creativity to the projects I make. When I was a kid, I had my own view of how the world worked at the micro-micro-level. I loved subatomic physics, and I spent many late nights trying to piece this extravagant puzzle together. I've written over 400 pages of work that, although not leading anywhere, are pretty fun to read through now.

I no longer aspire to be a theoretical physicist. But that same thinking, of wondering where specific things go, and how it all works together - is what programming is all about. After working in the industry at Gameloft, I know that being a backend developer contains a lot of admin work. Of asking what to do, gathering information from different teams... which was another plus for me, because I also love talking to different people. It's more in the realm of romanticism, but I think getting to meet everyone of all different views is what gives life it's flavour.

So (if you've read my About section), in my leap of faith to become a programmer I found peace. I always struggled with knowing what I want. I'm glad that programming is so diverse in what you can do, that I can explore so many mediums, and that I can problem-solve and talk to a whole range of different people. As the field becomes more diverse, I look more and more forward to the future. I wonder what new technologies will be here, what tools people will make, and what we can dream of!
