The last two years have been really hard. I’m sure it’s been for everyone.

I’ve learned of some bad news from a friend recently and feel awful about it. It shows that I’m not the only one with problems coming from the pandemic; some have it much worse, and it’s about time we start looking out for eachother because of that.

Last year, I made it my resolution to be more present. The last year, it was the same; the year before that, the same thing. I feel like it’s become a problem of constantly reaching for it, that makes me deviate from simply being a part of everything around me. I hope I’ve learned from that.

With how much is going on out there, I find the best thing for us to do is to have a silent understanding of how bad it can get, and use that as a baseline to become better people. I always found it troubling to become mature because of how easy it was to fool around. Now I know that there’s so much more to life than just that.

I remember someone telling me that as we get older, our problems deviate in size. But we become, overall more aware of everything. I feel like right now, I’m at a stage in life where I can grow as a person and fully mature into some idea of who I want to be. And I think it starts with being true to how I feel, and not think all the time about how I should act or who I should surround myself with. Although I do think parts of that are important, and it has changed me quite a bit, there’s still the core of me that I should always work on. And I’m going to stick with that for the rest of my life.

My new years resolution used to be all about putting myself out there. I’m still going to do that, but also take the time to turn the sails of who I want to end up as at the end of my university experience. There’s no picturesque goal in mind, really; just a rough idea of what I’ve seen before that’s good, and my goal to become something alongside that.

Thanks for reading.
