As I write this, it is 5:13 PM EST. I just finished my last shift here at Gameloft for the week!

It was a really fun time. I remember the first day I was stressed out of my mind because of how hard it was to start things. I had issues with my hardware (that I can confidently say were out of my control), so I actually had to run back twice in one day to get all the parts I needed - a non-glossy monitor, and a wifi adapter.

After that though, I started reading up on documentation, got to meet the team, and ended up merging my first ticket into the palantir workspace.


-- end of first week
