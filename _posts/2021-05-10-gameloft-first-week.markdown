It's 4:25 on a Friday afternoon, and I felt the urge to write. Probably not out of necessity, and probably more out of boredom. So here I am.

Random thought: I think writing is important. Really. The fact that you can write down your ideas, and if you get stuck on them, identify what's wrong, why you're stuck on them, and feel the reality behind that is a great source of introspection. I usually journal, but as it turns out, I think blogging and having these posts online make me put more effort into them. It's not just an echo chamber, it's a place where I feel like I'm being judged. And in a way, that can make all the difference between a rabbit hole and a, well, something different that's good and brilliant.

So, I think I'll write here more often. Today I'm a little frustrated because I had a whole self-reflection post written out, but I kept changing so much of it that it became inauthentic and weird. So far, this feels leagues better, and I think that's pretty awesome.

That's it! I'll see you in another one.
